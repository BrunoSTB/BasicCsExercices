# MyMonthlyBudget
I've created this console app because i was tired of creating excel copies on my google drive.
It is a simple program, that generates an excel sheet, containing three kinds of budges: Living Essentials, Discretionary and Savings.
When you run the program, type your budget for the month, then, it's going to be generated an excel file splitting your income into the three kinds of budget (the default percentages are 50/25/25).
