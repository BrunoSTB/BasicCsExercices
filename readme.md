# About this repository
This repositoryhas been created as i'm doing a couple of C# basic courses, to solidify my knowledge and collect a couple of certificates.
Please note that these are by no means made to be big and complex projects, just me trying out a thing or two. And, even though these are projects as simple as they can be, i'm posting them to keep a backup for my future self.
